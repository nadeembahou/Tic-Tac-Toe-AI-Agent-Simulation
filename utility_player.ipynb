    "# Tic-Tac-Toe Utility Player\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the implementation of a tic-tac-toe agent that evaluates moves using a utility function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "The `UtilityPlayer` class represents a tic-tac-toe agent that evaluates moves with a utility function. It inherits from `ConditionalPlayer` and uses conditional logic for making decisive moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `get_next_move` method\n",
    "\n",
    "This method gets the next move using an utility function and conditional logic for decisive moves. It first checks if the board is empty and returns the center position if so. Then, it checks for decisive moves using the `get_decisive_move` method. If no decisive move is found, it calculates the utility of each empty space on the board and selects the one with the highest utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `get_utility_of_spaces` method\n",
    "\n",
    "This method calculates the utility of each empty space on the board by calling the `get_utility` method for each space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `get_utility` method\n",
    "\n",
    "This method calculates the utility of placing a mark in a specific spot on the board. It considers the current state of the board and assigns utility based on the number of marks in each line."
